    Prevent potential infinite loop in Local Watchdog plugin

    Under given circumstances, it is possible for one of the
    local watchdog plugins to fall into an infinite loop.
    Changes were made to reduce the number of loops and
    to reduce the loop to no more than 2 minutes since older
    OSs take longer to report requested system resources.
    Additionally, unnecessary sleep operations have been
    eliminated.  As a result, the plugin `20_sysinfo` will
    take less time to run.
