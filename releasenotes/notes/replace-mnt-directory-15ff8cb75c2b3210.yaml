    Use new task install default for non-RHTS package

    For restraint-rhts package, tasks are installed and executed
    beneath `/mnt/tests`.  For non-rhts `restraint`
    installations, this path has changed to a more appropriate
    location.

    The `20_sysinfo` plugin processes journalctl log in a temporary location
    instead of `/mnt` as it is just an interim event.
