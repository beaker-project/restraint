    Stop logging `LWD is disabled` every minute

    When LWD (Local Watchdog) is disabled, there is a message in the
    harness log that reports this every minute.  The message looks
    like: `Localwatchdog at:  Disabled! `.  This changeset makes sure
    it is no longer reported repeatedly when `no_localwatchdog=true`
    is configured in the task `metadata` file.  To ensure there is some
    type of keepalive mechanism, the client now performs ssh keepalive
    towards the server.  This timeout value is configurable by use
    of the restraint client option `--timeout` which only affects default
    behavior. The timeout value has no effect when the `rsh` argument
    is used.
