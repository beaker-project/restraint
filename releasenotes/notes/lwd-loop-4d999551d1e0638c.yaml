    Resolve loop in local watchdog plugin
 
    When the local watchdog (LWD) expires a task, the LWD plugin `20_sysinfo`
    goes into an infinite loop since the directory `/mnt/testarea` is not
    created for the non-rhts restraint package. An error returned by `diff`
    utility within an infinite loop was not anticipated.  The fix
    terminates the infinite loop when diff returns error.
