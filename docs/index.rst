Welcome to Restraint's Documentation!
=====================================

Restraint is designed to execute tasks. These tasks can be tests which
report results or simply code that you want to automate.
Which tasks to execute is determined by a job [#]_. The job also describes
where to retrieve the tasks from and what parameters to pass in. These
tasks can report multiple PASS, FAIL, WARN results along with an optional
score. Tasks also have the ability to report log files. Each task can
have metadata describing dependencies and max run time for example.
Execution and reporting can be further enhanced with plugins.

Restraint can be used with Beaker [#]_ since it talks Beaker's Harness API [#]_
for reporting results. It can also be used stand-alone.

Features
--------

* Tasks can be retrieved directly from git.
* Does not rely on Anaconda/kickstart to install task dependencies.
* Can be statically linked to make it easier to test the system without changing
  the system.
* Can be run stand-alone without Beaker.

  - Tasks are executed with the same environment (no surprises when run later
    in Beaker).
  - Developing tasks is much quicker since you don't have to build task RPMs,
    schedule a system, provision a system, etc...

* Can be easily extended with Plugins.
* Uses Beaker's job XML.

The following documentation will show you how to use Restraint in both
environments.
